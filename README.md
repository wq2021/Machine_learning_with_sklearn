# Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

### In this project, we will try to figure out the whole process of a Machine Learning project and how to achieve it with Scikit-learn. This project is significantly inspired by the course [Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-learn](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/index.html) by Inria. Meanwhile, I will put my proper reflection into it in order to make the project more precisely and completely.


Generally, a Machine Learning project is composed of the following steps:
<ol>
    <li>Business Modelling</li>
    <li>Data Collection</li>
    <li>Data Wrangling</li>
    <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
    <li>Model Development</li>
    <li>Model Testing</li>
    <li>Model Deployment</li>
    <li>Model Monitoring</li>
</ol>

We can find a detailed explanation of each referenced step in the [Jupyter Notebook file](ML_project.ipynb).
